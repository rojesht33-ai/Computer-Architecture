# Lab 7: VHDL Code for Sequential Circuits — Flip-Flops

---

## Objective

- Design and simulate SR, D, JK, and T flip-flops using VHDL.
- Examine the function of the clock signal in governing sequential circuit behavior.

---

## Theory

A flip-flop is a bistable sequential storage element capable of holding one bit of information. In contrast to combinational logic, a flip-flop's output is determined not only by its present inputs but also by its previously stored state. Each flip-flop examined in this lab is edge-triggered, responding specifically to the **rising edge** of the clock signal.

---

### SR Flip-Flop

The SR flip-flop is governed by two control inputs, Set (S) and Reset (R). Applying a logic HIGH to both inputs simultaneously produces an undefined, forbidden output state.

| S   | R   | Q (next)      |
| --- | --- | ------------- |
| 0   | 0   | Q (no change) |
| 0   | 1   | 0 (reset)     |
| 1   | 0   | 1 (set)       |
| 1   | 1   | X (forbidden) |

---

### D Flip-Flop

The D flip-flop transfers the logic value present at input D to its output on every rising clock edge, thereby resolving the ambiguity inherent in the SR flip-flop's forbidden state.

```
Q(next) = D
```

---

### JK Flip-Flop

The JK flip-flop refines the SR design by removing its undefined condition. Instead of producing an invalid output, asserting both J and K simultaneously causes the flip-flop to **toggle** its state.

```
Q(next) = J·Q' + K'·Q
```

| J   | K   | Q (next)      |
| --- | --- | ------------- |
| 0   | 0   | Q (no change) |
| 0   | 1   | 0 (reset)     |
| 1   | 0   | 1 (set)       |
| 1   | 1   | Q' (toggle)   |

---

### T Flip-Flop

The T (Toggle) flip-flop inverts its stored output whenever T is asserted, and retains its current state when T is de-asserted.

```
Q(next) = T ⊕ Q
```

| T   | Q (next)      |
| --- | ------------- |
| 0   | Q (no change) |
| 1   | Q' (toggle)   |

## Testbench File

**Filename:** `ff_tb.vhd`

A unified testbench was developed to instantiate and exercise all four flip-flop designs concurrently. A continuous 20 ns-period clock is generated via a concurrent signal assignment. The stimulus process then applies input sequences to each flip-flop in turn, exercising every valid operating condition — Set, Reset, Hold, and Toggle — with each condition sustained for 40 ns (equivalent to two clock cycles) to guarantee reliable edge-triggered capture.

## Simulation File

**Filename:** `flipflops.vcd`

This Value Change Dump file is produced by GHDL upon execution of the testbench. It captures every transition of the clock, input, and output signals for all four flip-flop instances throughout the simulation, and serves as the input source for visual verification within GTKWave.

---

## Output

The generated waveform was imported into GTKWave, where the clock signal along with all flip-flop input and output traces were added to the display and the view was zoomed to fit the full simulation window.

**Observation:** Each of the four flip-flops exhibited the expected behavior in response to its respective input conditions at every rising clock edge. The SR flip-flop performed set and reset operations correctly while never entering the forbidden state. The D flip-flop reliably captured the input value at each rising edge. The JK flip-flop toggled as expected under the J = K = 1 condition. The T flip-flop toggled on each rising edge while T remained asserted and held its state once T was de-asserted. In every case, the QB output remained the logical complement of Q.

## Discussion and Conclusion

This lab presented the design and verification of four fundamental sequential circuit building blocks — the SR, D, JK, and T flip-flops — implemented in VHDL using behavioral modeling. Each design relied on rising-edge clock triggering and an internal state signal to drive both the Q and QB outputs. Verification was carried out through a single integrated testbench featuring a generated clock and a sequential stimulus process covering all valid operating conditions for each device. The resulting GTKWave waveform confirmed correct functional behavior across all test cases, encompassing state retention, setting, resetting, and toggling. Through this exercise, a solid grounding in clocked sequential circuit design was established, providing the foundation necessary for constructing registers, counters, and finite state machines in the labs to follow.
